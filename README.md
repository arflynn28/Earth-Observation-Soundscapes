# Earth-Observation-Soundscapes
A sonification project that translates Earth observation data into musical compositions using datasets like elevation, temperature, vegetation, and urban activity. The project uses geospatial features to generate MIDI-style sequences for an artistic interpretation of Earth's landscapes.
